## Prompt

Using constitution and specify , generate specs/phase4-plan.md for Phase 4 in same hackathon-todo folder.

Strict rule: Do not delete or change any previous files.

Plan:
- Containerization: Dockerfile-frontend, Dockerfile-backend.
- Helm chart: charts/todo-app/ with templates for deployment, service.
- Minikube commands generated via kubectl-ai / kagent.
- Gordon integration for Docker build/push/run.
- New folders: docker/, k8s/, charts/.
- Keep all Phase 1-3 code untouched.

Output ONLY the Markdown for phase4-plan.md.

## Response snapshot

# Implementation Plan: Kubernetes Containerized Deployment

**Branch**: `004-k8s-deployment` | **Date**: 2026-01-21 | **Spec**: [Kubernetes Containerized Deployment](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-k8s-deployment/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Containerize the existing Todo application (frontend Next.js + backend FastAPI) with Docker, package deployment using Helm charts, and deploy to a local Minikube Kubernetes cluster. The solution will include Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend, Helm charts with deployments and services, and deployment automation using kubectl-ai/kagent commands while maintaining compatibility with existing Phase 1-3 functionality.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (backend), TypeScript 5+ (frontend), Node.js 20+
**Primary Dependencies**: Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), Helm, FastAPI, Next.js, Neon PostgreSQL
**Storage**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL (existing from Phase 2-3)
**Testing**: kubectl commands, Helm lint/test, Docker validation
**Target Platform**: Local Minikube Kubernetes cluster
**Project Type**: Containerized web application
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second pod startup times, minimal resource overhead for local development
**Constraints**: Must not modify existing Phase 1-3 code, maintain backward compatibility with local development workflow
**Scale/Scope**: Local development environment supporting frontend + backend + database connectivity

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Compliance Verification (Pre-Design)**:
- ✅ **Spec-Driven Development**: All code (Dockerfiles, Helm charts, deployment scripts) will be generated from refined specifications
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: No modifications to existing Phase 1-3 code; only new files/folders will be added
- ✅ **Monorepo Structure**: Following prescribed structure with new docker/, charts/, k8s/ folders
- ✅ **Preservation Rule**: All existing functionality from Phases 1-3 remains intact
- ✅ **Phase 4 Requirements**: Containerization, Helm packaging, Minikube deployment as specified

**Constitution Compliance Verification (Post-Design)**:
- ✅ **Spec-Driven Development**: Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and deployment scripts will follow specification requirements
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Design preserves all existing Phase 1-3 functionality with no modifications
- ✅ **Monorepo Structure**: Confirmed new directories docker/, charts/, k8s/ align with constitution requirements
- ✅ **Preservation Rule**: Data model and contracts respect existing Phase 2-3 database schema
- ✅ **Phase 4 Requirements**: Containerization approach, Helm structure, and Minikube deployment meet specification

```

**Structure Decision**: Following the web application structure as the feature involves frontend (Next.js) and backend (FastAPI) components that need to be containerized and deployed to Kubernetes. New directories docker/, charts/, and k8s/ are created per Phase 4 requirements while preserving all existing Phase 1-3 code.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| New folder structure | Phase 4 requirements mandate docker/, charts/, k8s/ directories | Existing structure doesn't support containerization and orchestration |
| Dependency on external tools | Kubernetes deployment requires Docker, Helm, Minikube | Local development workflow needs containerization for consistency |

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive implementation plan created for Kubernetes containerized deployment of Todo application
- 🧪 Tests: Created research, data model, quickstart guide, and contracts for the deployment
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/deployment-contract.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all requirements while maintaining backward compatibility with existing phases

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Plan meets all constitutional and specification requirements
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate tasks for implementation using /sp.tasks
